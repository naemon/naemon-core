 * Red-Black tree, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-black_tree
 *
 * A red-black tree is a binary search tree where each node has a color
 * attribute, the value of which is either red or black.  Essentially, it
 * is just a convenient way to express a 2-3-4 binary search tree where
 * the color indicates whether the node is part of a 3-node or a 4-node.
 * In addition to the ordinary requirements imposed on binary search
 * trees, we make the following additional requirements of any valid
 * red-black tree:
 *  1) The root is black.
 *  2) All leaves are black.
 *  3) Both children of each red node are black.
 *  4) The paths from each leaf up to the root each contain the same
 *     number of black nodes.
