/**

 * @brief RedBlack tree library
 *
 * This library implements the algorithm for red-black trees, as
 * described at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree
 * Red-Black trees provide insert, find and delete in O(log n) time
 * in O(n) space. Inorder, preorder and postorder iteration is done
 * in O(n) time.
 *
 * This implementation was originally written by Todd C. Miller
 * <todd.Miller@courtesan.com> and was taken from Apple's "sudo"
 * program. It has been modified to match the libnaemon naming
 * scheme and naemon's (future) usage of it as a replacement for
 * the horrible skiplists, which provide the same operations as
 * red-black trees, but are an order of magnitude slower in the
 * worst case; in reality, skiplists are 50% slower than red-black
 * trees, but use more memory than red-black trees to guarantee
 * that (worse) performance.
