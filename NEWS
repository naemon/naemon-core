  * Add new NEB callback API version with better support for communicating cancellation and override reasons
  * Naemon now consistently logs when a notification is suppressed, along with

    feature is enabled by default, and can be overridden by setting
    enable_notification_suppression_reason_logging=0 in naemon.cfg.

    which makes it much more reliable (no more lost or orphaned events!)

    (status_update_interval=0)

    naemon would leave you with two instances running

    if it's set

  * Various init script fixes
  * Fix a race condition that would sometimes lead to complete deadlock

    node removal behaviour in the former
  * Fix a race condition that would sometimes occur during a reload
  * Fix a bug in signal handling code which would sometimes cause the command
    file worker to become defunct
  * Fix a bug where the specified retry_interval of a service or host
    would not be properly respected, and the check_interval would be used instead
  * Fix a potential crash (segfault) when freeing parent/child references
  * Fix a bug where "stale" objects would only have one freshness check executed
  * Fix improper handling of CHECK_OPTION_FORCE_EXECUTION, which would lead to
    checks not being run, despite being forcibly scheduled

    start regardless

Other:
  * Grafted Nagios git history onto Naemon's for easier code archeology

    error handling, fixed memory leaks, logging and refactoring
