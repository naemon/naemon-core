# naemon.cfg - Sample Main Config File for Naemon @VERSION@
#
# Read the documentation for more information on this configuration
# file.  I've provided some comments here, but things may not be so
# clear without further explanation.
#
#
##############################################################################


# LOG FILE
# This is the main log file where service and host events are logged
# for historical purposes.  This should be the first option specified
# in the config file!!!

log_file=@logdir@/naemon.log



# OBJECT CONFIGURATION FILE(S)
# These are the object configuration files in which you define hosts,
# host groups, contacts, contact groups, services, etc.
# You can split your object definitions across several config files
# if you wish (as shown below), or keep them all in a single config file.

# You can specify individual object config files as shown below:
#cfg_file=@pkgconfdir@/objects/commands.cfg
#cfg_file=@pkgconfdir@/objects/contacts.cfg
#cfg_file=@pkgconfdir@/objects/timeperiods.cfg
#cfg_file=@pkgconfdir@/objects/templates.cfg


# You can also tell naemon to process all config files (with a .cfg
# extension) in a particular directory by using the cfg_dir
# directive as shown below:
cfg_dir=@pkgconfdir@/conf.d




# OBJECT CACHE FILE
# This option determines where object definitions are cached when
# naemon starts/restarts.  The CGIs read object definitions from
# this cache file (rather than looking at the object config files
# directly) in order to prevent inconsistencies that can occur
# when the config files are modified after naemon starts.

object_cache_file=@localstatedir@/objects.cache



# PRE-CACHED OBJECT FILE
# This options determines the location of the precached object file.
# If you run naemon with the -p command line option, it will preprocess
# your object configuration file(s) and write the cached config to this
# file.  You can then start naemon with the -u option to have it read
# object definitions from this precached file, rather than the standard
# object configuration files (see the cfg_file and cfg_dir options above).
# Using a precached object file can speed up the time needed to (re)start
# the naemon process if you've got a large and/or complex configuration.
# Read the documentation section on optimizing naemon to find our more
# about how this feature works.

precached_object_file=@localstatedir@/objects.precache



# RESOURCE FILE
# This is an optional resource file that contains $USERx$ macro
# definitions. Multiple resource files can be specified by using
# multiple resource_file definitions.  The CGIs will not attempt to
# read the contents of resource files, so information that is
# considered to be sensitive (usernames, passwords, etc) can be
# defined as macros in this file and restrictive permissions (600)
# can be placed on this file.

resource_file=@pkgconfdir@/resource.cfg



# STATUS FILE
# This is where the current status of all monitored services and
# hosts is stored.  Its contents are read and processed by the CGIs.
# The contents of the status file are deleted every time naemon
#  restarts.

status_file=@localstatedir@/status.dat



# STATUS FILE UPDATE INTERVAL
# This option determines the frequency (in seconds) that
# naemon will periodically dump program, host, and
# service status data. Set it to 0 to disable updates.

status_update_interval=10



# EXTERNAL COMMAND OPTION
# This option allows you to specify whether or not Naemon should check
# for external commands (in the command file defined below).  By default
# Naemon will *not* check for external commands, just to be on the
# cautious side.  If you want to be able to use the CGI command interface
# you will have to enable this.
# Values: 0 = disable commands, 1 = enable commands

check_external_commands=1



# EXTERNAL COMMAND FILE
# This is the file that Naemon checks for external command requests.
# It is also where the command CGI will write commands that are submitted
# by users, so it must be writeable by the user that the web server
# is running as (usually 'nobody').  Permissions should be set at the
# directory level instead of on the file, as the file is deleted every
# time its contents are processed.

command_file=@localstatedir@/naemon.cmd



# QUERY HANDLER INTERFACE
# This is the socket that is created for the Query Handler interface

#query_socket=@localstatedir@/naemon.qh



# LOCK FILE
# This is the lockfile that Naemon will use to store its PID number
# in when it is running in daemon mode.

lock_file=@lockfile@



# TEMP FILE
# This is a temporary file that is used as scratch space when Naemon
# updates the status log, cleans the comment file, etc.  This file
# is created, used, and deleted throughout the time that Naemon is
# running.

temp_file=@localstatedir@/naemon.tmp



# TEMP PATH
# This is path where Naemon can create temp files for service and
# host check results, etc.

temp_path=@TMPDIR@



# EVENT BROKER OPTIONS
# Controls what (if any) data gets sent to the event broker.
# Values:  0      = Broker nothing
#         -1      = Broker everything
#         <other> = See documentation

event_broker_options=-1



# EVENT BROKER MODULE(S)
# This directive is used to specify an event broker module that should
# be loaded by Naemon at startup.  Use multiple directives if you want
# to load more than one module.  Arguments that should be passed to
# the module at startup are separated from the module path by a space.
#
# Example:
#
#   broker_module=<modulepath> [moduleargs]

#broker_module=@libdir@/naemon-livestatus/livestatus.so @TMPDIR@/live

#broker_module=/somewhere/module2.o arg1 arg2=3 debug=0

# LOG ARCHIVE PATH
# This is the directory where archived (rotated) log files are placed by the
# logrotate daemon. It is used by out of core add-ons to discover the logfiles.

log_archive_path=@logdir@/archives



# LOGGING OPTIONS
# If you want messages logged to the syslog facility, as well as the
# Naemon log file set this option to 1.  If not, set it to 0.

# NOTIFICATION LOGGING OPTION
# If you don't want notifications to be logged, set this value to 0.
# If notifications should be logged, set the value to 1.

log_notifications=1

# Notification suppression reason (NSR) logging causes the reason for a
# notification suppression to be logged, when it occurs. This can potentially
# add some noise to your log file, but is highly useful when troubleshooting
# missing notifications.

# SERVICE RETRY LOGGING OPTION
# If you don't want service check retries to be logged, set this value
# to 0.  If retries should be logged, set the value to 1.

# to 1.

log_event_handlers=1



# INITIAL STATES LOGGING OPTION
# If you want Naemon to log all initial host and service states to
# the main log file (the first time the service or host is checked)
# you can enable this option by setting this value to 1.  If you
# are not using an external application that does long term state
# statistics reporting, you do not need to enable this option.  In
# this case, set the value to 0.

log_initial_states=0



# CURRENT STATES LOGGING OPTION
# If you don't want Naemon to log all current host and service states
# after log has been rotated to the main log file, you can disable this
# option by setting this value to 0. Default value is 1.

log_current_states=1



# EXTERNAL COMMANDS LOGGING OPTION
# If you don't want Naemon to log external commands, set this value
# to 0.  If external commands should be logged, set this value to 1.
# Note: This option does not include logging of passive service

# If you don't want Naemon to log passive host and service checks, set
# this value to 0.  If passive checks should be logged, set
# this value to 1.

log_passive_checks=1



# GLOBAL HOST AND SERVICE EVENT HANDLERS
# These options allow you to specify a host and service event handler
# command that is to be run for every host or service state change.
# The global event handler is executed immediately prior to the event
# handler that you have optionally specified in each host or
# service definition. The command argument is the short name of a
# command definition that you define in your host configuration file.
# Read the HTML docs for more information.

#global_host_event_handler=somecommand
#global_service_event_handler=somecommand



# MAXIMUM CONCURRENT SERVICE CHECKS
# This option allows you to specify the maximum number of
# service checks that can be run in parallel at any given time.
# Specifying a value of 1 for this variable essentially prevents
# any service checks from being parallelized.  A value of 0
# will not restrict the number of concurrent checks that are
# being executed.

max_concurrent_checks=0


# CHECK RESULT PATH
# This is directory where Naemon reads check results of host and
# service checks to further process them.
#
# Note: Naemon does not require this folder internally but it still
# can be used to pass check results to Naemon.

check_result_path=@CHECKRESULTDIR@


# CACHED HOST CHECK HORIZON
# This option determines the maximum amount of time (in seconds)
# that the state of a previous host check is considered current.
# Cached host states (from host checks that were performed more
# recently that the timeframe specified by this value) can immensely
# improve performance in regards to the host check logic.
# Too high of a value for this option may result in inaccurate host
# states being used by Naemon, while a lower value may result in a
# performance hit for host checks.  Use a value of 0 to disable host
# check caching.

cached_host_check_horizon=15



# CACHED SERVICE CHECK HORIZON
# This option determines the maximum amount of time (in seconds)
# that the state of a previous service check is considered current.
# Cached service states (from service checks that were performed more
# recently that the timeframe specified by this value) can immensely
# improve performance in regards to predictive dependency checks.
# Use a value of 0 to disable service check caching.

cached_service_check_horizon=15



# ENABLE PREDICTIVE HOST DEPENDENCY CHECKS
# This option determines whether or not Naemon will attempt to execute
# checks of hosts when it predicts that future dependency logic test
# may be needed.  These predictive checks can help ensure that your
# host dependency logic works well.
# Values:
#  0 = Disable predictive checks
#  1 = Enable predictive checks (default)

enable_predictive_host_dependency_checks=1



# ENABLE PREDICTIVE SERVICE DEPENDENCY CHECKS
# This option determines whether or not Naemon will attempt to execute

# service dependency logic works well.
# Values:
#  0 = Disable predictive checks
#  1 = Enable predictive checks (default)

enable_predictive_service_dependency_checks=1



# SOFT STATE DEPENDENCIES
# This option determines whether or not Naemon will use soft state
# information when checking host and service dependencies. Normally
# Naemon will only use the latest hard host or service state when
# checking dependencies. If you want it to use the latest state (regardless
# of whether its a soft or hard state type), enable this option.
# Values:
#  0 = Don't use soft state dependencies (default)
#  1 = Use soft state dependencies

soft_state_dependencies=0



# TIME CHANGE ADJUSTMENT THRESHOLDS
# These options determine when Naemon will react to detected changes
# in system time (either forward or backwards).

#time_change_threshold=900



# TIMEOUT VALUES
# These options control how much time Naemon will allow various
# types of commands to execute before killing them off.  Options
# are available for controlling maximum time allotted for
# service checks, host checks, event handlers, notifications, the

# RETAIN STATE INFORMATION
# This setting determines whether or not Naemon will save state
# information for services and hosts before it shuts down.  Upon
# startup Naemon will reload all saved service and host state
# information before starting to monitor.  This is useful for
# maintaining long-term data on state statistics, etc, but will
# slow Naemon down a bit when it (re)starts.  Since its only
# a one-time penalty, I think its well worth the additional
# startup delay.

retain_state_information=1



# STATE RETENTION FILE
# This is the file that Naemon should use to store host and
# service state information before it shuts down.  The state
# information in this file is also read immediately prior to
# starting to monitor the network when Naemon is restarted.
# This file is used only if the retain_state_information
# variable is set to 1.

state_retention_file=@localstatedir@/retention.dat



# RETENTION DATA UPDATE INTERVAL
# This setting determines how often (in minutes) that Naemon
# will automatically save retention data during normal operation.
# If you set this value to 0, Naemon will not save retention
# data at regular interval, but it will still save retention
# data before shutting down or restarting.  If you have disabled
# state retention, this option has no effect.

retention_update_interval=60



# USE RETAINED PROGRAM STATE
# This setting determines whether or not Naemon will set
# program status variables based on the values saved in the
# retention file.  If you want to use retained program status
# information, set this value to 1.  If not, set this value
# to 0.

use_retained_program_state=1



# USE RETAINED SCHEDULING INFO
# This setting determines whether or not Naemon will retain
# the scheduling info (next check time) for hosts and services
# based on the values saved in the retention file.  If you
# If you want to use retained scheduling info, set this
# value to 1.  If not, set this value to 0.

use_retained_scheduling_info=1


# RETAINED_SCHEDULING_RANDOMIZE_WINDOW
# If use_retained_scheduling info is enabled, this setting
# sets the window (in seconds), in which checks that were
# supposed to executed during a restart, is rescheduled.
# That is, if set to 60 seconds, then all checks that were
# missed due to a restart will be scheduled randomly to be
# executed in the first 60 seconds after a restart.
# If the retained_scheduling_randomize_window is larger than
# the objects check_interval, the check_interval is used
# instead.

retained_scheduling_randomize_window=60


# RETAINED ATTRIBUTE MASKS (ADVANCED FEATURE)
# The following variables are used to specify specific host and
# service attributes that should *not* be retained by Naemon during
# program restarts.
#
# The values of the masks are bitwise ANDs of values specified
# by the "MODATTR_" definitions found in include/common.h.
# For example, if you do not want the current enabled/disabled state
# of flap detection and event handlers for hosts to be retained, you
# would use a value of 24 for the host attribute mask...
# MODATTR_EVENT_HANDLER_ENABLED (8) + MODATTR_FLAP_DETECTION_ENABLED (16) = 24

# This mask determines what host attributes are not retained
retained_host_attribute_mask=0

# This mask determines what service attributes are not retained
retained_service_attribute_mask=0

# These two masks determine what process attributes are not retained.
# There are two masks, because some process attributes have host and service
# options.  For example, you can disable active host checks, but leave active
# service checks enabled.
retained_process_host_attribute_mask=0
retained_process_service_attribute_mask=0

# These two masks determine what contact attributes are not retained.
# There are two masks, because some contact attributes have host and
# service options.  For example, you can disable host notifications for
# a contact, but leave service notifications enabled for them.
retained_contact_host_attribute_mask=0
retained_contact_service_attribute_mask=0



# INTERVAL LENGTH
# This is the seconds per unit interval as used in the
# host/contact/service configuration files.  Setting this to 60 means
# that each interval is one minute long (60 seconds).  Other settings
# have not been tested much, so your mileage is likely to vary...

interval_length=60



# AGGRESSIVE HOST CHECKING OPTION
# If you don't want to turn on aggressive host checking features, set
# this value to 0 (the default).  Otherwise set this value to 1 to
# enable the aggressive check option. When disabled (0), Naemon will treat
# WARNING states as UP for host checks. This lets you use the same
# check plugin for host and service checks. Read the docs for more info
# on what aggressive host check is or check out the source code in
# src/naemon/checks_host.c

use_aggressive_host_checking=0



# SERVICE CHECK EXECUTION OPTION
# This determines whether or not Naemon will actively execute
# service checks when it initially starts.  If this option is
# disabled, checks are not actively made, but Naemon can still
# receive and process passive check results that come in.  Unless
# you're implementing redundant hosts or have a special need for
# disabling the execution of service checks, leave this enabled!
# Values: 1 = enable checks, 0 = disable checks

# Values: 1 = accept passive checks, 0 = reject passive checks

accept_passive_service_checks=1



# HOST CHECK EXECUTION OPTION
# This determines whether or not Naemon will actively execute
# host checks when it initially starts.  If this option is
# disabled, checks are not actively made, but Naemon can still
# receive and process passive check results that come in.  Unless
# you're implementing redundant hosts or have a special need for

# PROCESS PERFORMANCE DATA OPTION
# This determines whether or not Naemon will process performance
# data returned from service and host checks.  If this option is
# enabled, host performance data will be processed using the
# host_perfdata_command (defined below) and service performance
# data will be processed using the service_perfdata_command (also

# performance data.
# Values: 1 = process performance data, 0 = do not process performance data

process_performance_data=0



# HOST AND SERVICE PERFORMANCE DATA PROCESSING COMMANDS
# These commands are run after every host and service check is
# performed.  These commands are executed only if the

#host_perfdata_file=@localstatedir@/host-perfdata
#service_perfdata_file=@localstatedir@/service-perfdata



# HOST AND SERVICE PERFORMANCE DATA FILE TEMPLATES
# These options determine what data is written (and how) to the
# performance data files.  The templates may contain macros, special
# characters (\t for tab, \r for carriage return, \n for newline)
# and plain text.  A newline is automatically added after each write
# to the performance data file.  Some examples of what you can do are

# HOST AND SERVICE PERFORMANCE DATA FILE MODES
# This option determines whether or not the host and service
# performance data files are opened in write ("w") or append ("a")
# mode. If you want to use named pipes, you should use the special
# pipe ("p") mode which avoid blocking at startup, otherwise you will
# likely want the default append ("a") mode.

#service_perfdata_file_processing_command=process-service-perfdata-file



# HOST AND SERVICE PERFORMANCE DATA PROCESS EMPTY RESULTS
# These options determine whether the core will process empty perfdata
# results or not. This is needed for distributed monitoring, and intentionally
# turned on by default.
# If you don't require empty perfdata - saving some cpu cycles
# on unwanted macro calculation - you can turn that off. Be careful!

# OBSESS OVER SERVICE CHECKS OPTION
# This determines whether or not Naemon will obsess over service

#ochp_command=somecommand



# TRANSLATE PASSIVE HOST CHECKS OPTION
# This determines whether or not Naemon will translate
# DOWN/UNREACHABLE passive host check results into their proper
# state for this instance of Naemon.  This option is useful
# if you have distributed or failover monitoring setup.  In
# these cases your other Naemon servers probably have a different
# "view" of the network, with regards to the parent/child relationship
# of hosts.  If a distributed monitoring server thinks a host
# is DOWN, it may actually be UNREACHABLE from the point of
# this Naemon instance.  Enabling this option will tell Naemon
# to translate any DOWN or UNREACHABLE host states it receives
# passively into the correct state from the view of this server.
# Values: 1 = perform translation, 0 = do not translate (default)

translate_passive_host_checks=0



# PASSIVE HOST CHECKS ARE SOFT OPTION
# This determines whether or not Naemon will treat passive host
# checks as being HARD or SOFT.  By default, a passive host check

# by enabling this option.
# Values: 0 = passive checks are HARD, 1 = passive checks are SOFT

passive_host_checks_are_soft=0



# ORPHANED HOST/SERVICE CHECK OPTIONS
# These options determine whether or not Naemon will periodically
# check for orphaned host service checks.  Since service checks are
# not rescheduled until the results of their previous execution
# instance are processed, there exists a possibility that some
# checks may never get rescheduled.  A similar situation exists for
# host checks, although the exact scheduling details differ a bit
# from service checks.  Orphaned checks seem to be a rare
# problem and should not happen under normal circumstances.
# If you have problems with service checks never getting
# rescheduled, make sure you have orphaned service checks enabled.
# Values: 1 = enable checks, 0 = disable checks

check_for_orphaned_services=1
check_for_orphaned_hosts=1



# SERVICE FRESHNESS CHECK OPTION
# This option determines whether or not Naemon will periodically

service_freshness_check_interval=60



# SERVICE CHECK TIMEOUT STATE
# This setting determines the state Naemon will report when a
# service check times out - that is does not respond within
# service_check_timeout seconds.  This can be useful if a
# machine is running at too high a load and you do not want
# to consider a failed service check to be critical (the default).
# Valid settings are:
# c - Critical (default)
# u - Unknown
# w - Warning
# o - OK

# This setting determines the number of seconds that Naemon
# will add to any host and service freshness thresholds that
# it calculates (those not explicitly specified by the user).

additional_freshness_latency=15




# FLAP DETECTION OPTION
# This option determines whether or not Naemon will try
# and detect hosts and services that are "flapping".
# Flapping occurs when a host or service changes between
# states too frequently.  When Naemon detects that a
# host or service is flapping, it will temporarily suppress
# notifications for that host/service until it stops
# flapping.  Flap detection is very experimental, so read
# the HTML documentation before enabling this feature!
# Values: 1 = enable flap detection
#         0 = disable flap detection (default)

# DATE FORMAT OPTION
# This option determines how short dates are displayed.
# The following macros are affected by this:
#    $SHORTDATETIME$
#    $DATE$
# It also affects the used date format of downtime comments
# generated by Naemon.
# Valid options include:

# REGULAR EXPRESSION MATCHING
# This option controls whether or not regular expression matching
# takes place in the object config files.  Regular expression
# matching is used to match host, hostgroup, service, and service
# group names/descriptions in some fields of various object types.
# Values: 1 = enable regexp matching, 0 = disable regexp matching

# "TRUE" REGULAR EXPRESSION MATCHING
# This option controls whether or not "true" regular expression
# matching takes place in the object config files.  This option
# only has an effect if regular expression matching is enabled
# (see above).  If this option is DISABLED, regular expression
# matching only occurs if a string contains wildcard characters
# (* and ?).  If the option is ENABLED, regexp matching occurs
# all the time (which can be annoying).
# Values: 1 = enable true matching, 0 = disable true matching

# ADMINISTRATOR EMAIL/PAGER ADDRESSES
# The email and pager address of a global administrator (likely you).

# DEBUG LEVEL
# This option determines how much (if any) debugging information will

# MAX DEBUG FILE SIZE
# This option determines the maximum size (in bytes) of the debug file.  If
# the file grows larger than this size, it will be renamed with a .old

# DISABLE SERVICE CHECKS WHEN HOST DOWN
# This option will disable all service checks if the host is not in an UP state
#

# SET SERVICE/HOST STATUS WHEN SERVICE CHECK SKIPPED
# These options will allow you to set the status of a service when its
# service check is skipped due to the following reasons:
# 1) failed dependency check; 2) host not up 3) service parents failed
# Number 2 can only happen if 'host_down_disable_service_checks' above
# is set to 1.
# Valid values for the service* options are:
#     -1     Do not change the service status (default)
#     -2     Keep service running as long as it is ok/warning.
#      0     Set the service status to STATE_OK
#      1     Set the service status to STATE_WARNING

# The host_dependency_skip_check_status option will allow you to set the
# status of a host when its check is skipped due to a failed dependency check.
# Valid values for the host_dependency_skip_check_status are:
#     -1     Do not change the service status (default)
#     -2     Keep host running as long as it is up.

# CIRCULAR DEPENDENCIES (EXPERIMENTAL)

# contents of the files in the pointed-to directory was included on this line.
# The path to the directory is relative to the path of the main naemon.cfg
# file.
