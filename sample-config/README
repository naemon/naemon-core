SAMPLE CONFIG FILE README
=========================

This directory contains *sample* configuration files for Naemon.
You should read the HTML documentation for information on
customizing these config files to suit your needs.

A description of the sample config files and subdirectories
contained here follows:



CONTENTS:
---------

naemon.cfg       - This is a sample main config file

resource.cfg     - This is a sample resource config file, used for defining
                   custom macros, storing sensitive data, etc.

templates/       - This directory contains sample object config files. You'll
                   need to define object config files like these before you can
                   actually start to monitor anything.
